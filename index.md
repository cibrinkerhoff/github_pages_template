# Hello! I'm Corbin Brinkerhoff üëã

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This site shows my journey learning data science and analytics. Here you'll find projects that demonstrate what I've learned and discovered.

## Background

I'm a Bachelor of Statistics student at Brigham Young University with a Data Science emphasis, projected to graduate in April 2026. I enjoy applying statistical methods and programming to real-world data problems, and I'm currently taking advanced coursework in data science, linear regression, and machine learning. I lived two years in Portugal and became fluent in Portuguese, which I hope to use to help bridge data science opportunities internationally. I hope to pursue a career in data science or analytics after graduation, leveraging my skills to drive data-informed decision-making.

## Purpose of this Website

This website serves as a portfolio to showcase my learning journey in data science and analytics. It's a place where I document my projects, share insights, and demonstrate the skills I've developed throughout my studies.

## üéì About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data
